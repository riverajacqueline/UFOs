# UFO Sightings

## Overview

This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage for UFO sightings using Java Script, HTML, CSS, and BootStrap. The webpage allows users to filter for multiple critera at the same time. Available filters include date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results

Upon opening the web application, you will be brought to the home web page of UFO Sightings.

#### Web Page:

On the left side of the web page is where the filter search is located. The search can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

#### Filter Search:

A search can be done by using one filter. In this example, a search will be done using the date 1/10/2010

A search can be done using multiple filters. In this example, a search will be done using all five search critera.

## Summary
#### Drawbacks
- One drawback with this web application is that the search is case sensitive. The data given is all in lower case, therefor the user would have to search using lower case letters. If the user were to type in "Round Rock" instead of "round rock", no search results would appear.
- A second drawback is that for the user to search by city, they would need to know what city to search for. Without knowing what data is available, it might take the user a while before coming up with a city that is searchable.
#### Recommendations
- My first recommendation would be to make the search more user friendly by making it less case sensitive. If the user were to type "round rock" or "Round Rock", the results would show nonetheless.
- My second recommendation would to have a drop down of cities for each specific state so that the user is stuck trying to come up with city from their heads. I would also add a drop down for shape so users can choose a specific shape they want. If you were a user who did not know what shapes there were, this option would definitely help them.
- Lastly, I would recommend adding pictures for the sightings if they are available so users would be able to see real pictures to go along with the descriptions of the sightings.
